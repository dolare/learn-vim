##Work through a tutorial on openvim

1. In contrast to regular text editor, you can use keys h ,j, k, l instead of arrow keys to move the cursor.

2. To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use keys w, b, e. w moves to the start of next word; e moves to
the end of the word; and b moves to begnining of the word.

3. Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys. You can combine movement keys with a number, for 
example, 3w is the same as pressing w three times.

4. You can insert text multiple times. For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30-s. With 30ue
 Esc, there is no need to press - 39 times.

5. To find and move to the next occurrence of a character, use f and F, you can combine f with a number, for 
example 3rd occurence of 'q' with 3fq.

6. In text that is structured with parenthese or brackets, use % to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket.

7. To reach the beginning of a line, press 0. For the end of a line, there is $.

8. Find the next occurence of the word under cursor with *, and the previous with #.

9. gg takes you to the beginning of the file; G to the end. To jump directly to a specific line, give its
lines number along with G.

10. Searching text is a vital part of any text editor. In vim, you press / and give the text you are looking for.

11. To insert text into a new line, press o and O.

12. x and X delete the character under the cursor and to the left of the cursor repspectively.

13. when you need to replace only one character under your cursor without changing to insert mode, use r.

14. d is the delete command. You can combine it with movement, dw deletes the first word on the right side of the cursor,
it also copies the content, so that you can paste it with p to another location.

15. to repeat the previous command, just press .
